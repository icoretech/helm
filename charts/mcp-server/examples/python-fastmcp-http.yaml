# Example: Run the `mcp-server` FastMCP sample over streamable HTTP behind the gateway.
# Why: demonstrates servers[] Python via uv with custom args.

servers:
  - name: fastmcp
    port: 3000
    python:
      package: mcp-server
      args: ["--transport","streamable-http","--host","0.0.0.0","--port","3000"]
    register:
      enabled: false

# Gateway is managed by the Unla subchart (Service: <release-name>, port 5235)
